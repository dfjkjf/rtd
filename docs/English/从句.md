## 名词性从句

_Tom_ will go to _Shanghai_ _for work_ _by plane_ _next Tuesday_.

### 转换为疑问句

- 方法
    - 将句中需要提问的部分替换为相应的疑问代词，并将其至于居首，将助动词放在疑问代词后面，并将处于句尾的句号改为问号。
- 例子
    - `What` will Tome do next Tuesday?
    - `Who` will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday?
    - `Where` will Tom go for work by plane next Tuesday?
    - `How` will Tom go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday?
    - `When` will Tom go to Shanghai for work by plane?

### 转换为从句

- 方法1
    - 将句中需要提问的部分替换为相应的疑问代词，并将其至于居首。
- 例子
    - Everyone cares for `what Tom will do next Tuesday`.
    - `Who will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday` surprises Tom.
    - Everyone knows `where Tom will go for work by plane next Tuesday`.
    - Nobody considers `how Tom will go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday` desirable.
    - `When Tom will go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday` has not yet been announced.

- 方法2
    - 直接将引导词居于居首，`that`作宾语可省略，`if`和`wheatear`通常能替换，`if`引导的名词性从句不能作主语
- 例子
    - Everyone knows `(that) Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday`.
    - `Whether Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday` has not yet been announced.
    - The problem is `if Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday`.

### it：形式主语和形式宾语

为避免句子头重脚轻，理解难度较大，使用`it`来替换句子中的主语和宾语。

`Whether Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday` has not yet been announced.<br>
将`it`置于主语位置，将原来的主语置于句尾。<br>
`It` has not yet been announced `whether Tom will go to Shanghai for work by plane next Tuesday`.

Nobody considers `how Tom will go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday` desirable.<br>
将`it`置于宾语位置，将原来的宾语置于句尾。<br>
Nobody considers it desirable `how Tom will go to Shanghai for work next Tuesday`.


## 定语从句

The girl was in red. The girl broke the glass.

### 转换为从句

- 将句中需要提问的部分替换为相应的疑问代词，并将其至于居首。
    - The girl `who was in red` broke the glass.

### 定语从句的省略

当定语从句是`主+系+表`结构，且引导词为`who/which/that`时，可以通过省略引导词和be动词来简化句子。
- The girl `(who was)` in red broke the glass.
- I' m working in the building, `which was` built last year.

如果谓语不是be动词，则先改为be动词，再省略：
1. The company has introduced a new insurance plan that costs just $150 per person per month.
2. The company has introduced a new insurance plan that is costing just $150 per person per month.
3. The company has introduced a new insurance plan costing just $150 per person per month.

### 引导词

|引导词|替代对象|注意|
|---|---|---|
|who|人||
|whom|人|专用于书面语中替换宾语、介宾|
|which|物||
|that|人或物||
|where|地点||
|when|时间||
|whose|所有格||

当引导词是`who/whom/that/which`，且替换的是宾语或介宾时，引导词可省略

## 状语从句

状语从句是能够当作副词使用的从句，结构为：状语从句 = 从属连词 + 简单句。

**从属连词**

|属性|连词|例子|
|---|---|---|
|时间|when<br>while<br>befor<br>after<br>since|`After teacher went outside`, he told us answer.|
|条件|if<br>even if<br>as loong as|`If you see Shelly`, give her this backpack.|
|原因|because<br>as<br>since|I usually eat at home `as I like cooking`.|
|对比|although<br>even though<br>whereas<br>while|`Although I'm bad at football`, it's fun to play.|

> 当从句位于主句前，通常用逗号将之隔开。

### 状语从句的省略

如果从句的主语和主句的主语相同，则省略从句的主语和之后的be动词：
- While `(I was)` reading this book, I picked up more than one hundred printing mistakes.
- As `(she is)` a doctor, she sees people facing death every day.

如果谓语不是be动词，则先改为be动词，再省略：
1. Before he went for work, Tom took a shower.
2. Before he was going for work, Tom took a shower.
3. Before going for work, Tom took a shower.

## 并列句

并列句是多个单词、短语或句子的并列。

**并列连词**

|属性|连词|例子|
|---|---|---|
|原因|for|It's cold today, `for it snowed last night`.|
|共同|and|I like apples `and oranges`.|
|都不|nor|Neither John `nor Mary` is coming to the party.|
|转折|but|I wanted to go to the beach, `but it started to rain`.|
|选择|or|Do you want tea `or coffee`?|
|相反|yet|She is very smart `yet she never brags about it`.|
|因果|so|He didn't study for the exam, `so he didn't pass`.|
|选择|either or|The picture is either an original or an excellent copy.|
|都不|neither nor|Neither I nor she agreed with John.|
|递进|not olny but also|I not ony talked with him but also got his signature.|
|共同|both and|Both Tom and Mary like English.|

**but & yet**

`I wanted to go to the beach, but it started to rain.` 和 `I wanted to go to go the beach, yet it started to rain.` 这两个句子在结构上非常相似，都表达了想要去海滩的愿望与下雨这一现实之间的对比。然而，使用 `but` 和 `yet` 作为并列连词时，语气和强调点有细微的差别。
1. 使用 `but`：

    `But` 在这里强调了愿望与现实之间的直接对比。它通常用来指出两个相反或矛盾的情况。在这个句子中，`but` 强调了尽管有去海滩的愿望，但下雨这一事实阻止了这个愿望的实现。
2. 使用 `yet`：

    `Yet` 通常用于表示尽管存在某种情况，但另一种情况仍然成立。它有时用于强调意外或不寻常的对比。在这个句子中，使用 `yet` 可能会给人一种感觉，即尽管下雨了（这通常会阻止人们去海滩），但说话者仍然想要去海滩，或者在某种程度上，下雨并没有完全消除去海滩的愿望。

总的来说，`but` 更直接地表达了对比和矛盾，而 `yet` 则可能带有一种尽管有障碍，但愿望仍然存在的意味。在实际使用中，这种差别可能很微妙，有时可以根据个人的风格和句子的具体语境来选择使用哪一个连词。

### 比较句

比较句是并列句省略后的产物。

|连词|属性|例子|
|---|---|---|
|as...as..|第一个as副词，第二个as连词|Jay studies as hard as his brother `(studyies)`.|
|than|连词，比|Jay studies hard than his brother `(studyies)`.|

### 并列句的省略

- We desire happiness and `(we desire)` health.
